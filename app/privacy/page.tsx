          RH Strategic Consulting DBA RH Consulting (“RH Consulting,” “we,” “us,”
          or “our”) is committed to respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
          explains what information we collect through our website,{" "}
          <a href="https://www.rhconsulting.ai">www.rhconsulting.ai</a> (the
          “Website”), how we use it, and the measures we take to protect it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our Website is hosted on third-party services (e.g., Wix) that help us
          operate the site. Those providers may process data on our behalf
          consistent with this Policy and their own privacy terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information in two broad categories:</p>

        <h3>1) Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
          Details that identify or relate to a specific person—such as your
          name, email address, phone number, company, and role/title. We may
          collect this when you engage with our AI receptionist (chatbot),
          submit forms, request a quote, book a meeting, complete a checkout, or
          subscribe to updates.
        </p>

        <h3>2) Usage / Non-Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
          Information that does not, on its own, identify you—such as IP
          address, device and browser type, operating system, pages viewed,
          referring pages, time and date of visits, and general interaction
          data. We collect this automatically via cookies, pixels, and similar
          technologies to help us understand and improve site performance.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>

        </ul>

        <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <h3>Service Providers</h3>
        <p>
          We engage trusted vendors who assist with hosting, email delivery,
          analytics (e.g., Google), payment processing, security, forms/CRM, and
          similar operational tasks. They may access Personal Information only
          to perform services for us and must keep it confidential.
        </p>
        <h3>Legal and Safety</h3>
        <p>
          We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, court
          order, or to investigate, prevent, or address suspected fraud, security
          issues, or harm to rights and property.
        </p>
        <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>
          If we undergo a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets,
          your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>

          designed to protect your information against unauthorized access,
          disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of
